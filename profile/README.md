# 👾 PixelUndHammer

**Welcome to PixelUndHammer!**  
We’re a small, non-profit hobbyist organization exploring the world of **3D printing**, **electronics**, and the occasional **software project**.

🔧 Whether it's building, printing, soldering, or coding – we’re all about making things for the fun of it.
